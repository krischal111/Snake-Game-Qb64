# Snake-Game-Qb64

This game was made by Krischal Khanal (I will call him as me, because I am Krischal who wrote this Readme.md file), about in 2018. This was made in QB64 progam, using a little modified QBASIC version (QB64). I used that language because that was the only language I knew at the time. I made this in about a week's time, the free time after quitting small apprenticeship in a Photocopy shop, and before my +2 journey began.
